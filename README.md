# CMPE-255-Advanced-Dimensionality-Reduction

This repository demonstrates a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques using multiple datasets, including both image and tabular data. The project is designed to explore and compare the performance of these techniques, providing insights into their strengths and limitations.  

## Overview  

This project explores the following dimensionality reduction techniques:  

- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)  
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)  
- ISOMAP  
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)  
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)  
- Randomized Principal Component Analysis (Randomized PCA)  
- Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA)  
- Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA)  
- Factor Analysis (Scikit-learn)  
- Autoencoders  

The assignment includes:  
1. Colab notebooks demonstrating the techniques on image and tabular datasets.  
2. A Databricks notebook showcasing dimensionality reduction techniques.  
3. Interactive visualizations to aid in understanding the results.
